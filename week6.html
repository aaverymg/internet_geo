  <h4>Quincy Childs: This Has Nothing to Do With Clouds</h4>
  <p>This text discusses the materiality of internet infrastructure, but from a slightly different angle than most other discussions of this topic. Generally, “internet materiality” refers to the hardware- the cables, the servers, the computers, etc. In this text, Childs instead talks about the “elemental materiality of data”- the heat generated by data centers. She states that “The susceptibility to overheating illustrates that computer servers are designed to waste more energy than they use”, highlighting the fact that in this case, renewable energy would need to consider both input and output, as well as internal processes. Is it possible to alter our computer hardware to create less waste? Do we instead just need to think about better uses for this waste? Could we repurpose this extra heat so it stops being “waste”? She also considers the ways in which data centers are a special case in the broader discussion around renewable energy-  “therein lies the anomaly of the data center, namely that its threats are self-generating: as the processing power accelerates, offsetting the heat of its own production is critical to its functioning.” This further gives the sense that this is some sort of major oversight or design flaw in our systems. However, the fact that data centers are an anomaly of sorts arguably means that we need to pay more attention to how they fit into broader systems. Data centers may be a special case, but they’re also a widespread and necessary component of many of our systems- they can’t be neglected in our analysis of these systems.</p>
