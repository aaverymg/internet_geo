  <h4>Josh Lepawsky: What E-Waste Journalism Gets Wrong</h4>
  <p>In this article, Lepawsky talks about journalism surrounding electronic waste, and specifically what this coverage tends to neglect. Journalist coverage tends to mostly focus on discarded devices, which are the entire assembled devices that end up in the landfill once they stop working. Reporting around e-waste tends to focus exclusively on this, rather than on the mining and manufacturing processes involved in electronic production, which are far more wasteful and environmentally damaging. This focus on individual consumer waste, rather than looking at the larger underlying systems, shifts the blame for e-waste from the larger corporate systems to the (ultimately mostly powerless) individuals. The author also discusses ways in which e-waste journalism is often inaccurate, poorly researched, or misleading. For example, a common misconception is that electronic waste gets shipped from North America and Europe to Asia because it’s cheaper to dump trash overseas. However, looking at landfill use costs and shipping prices makes it clear that this isn’t the case. Because of this misunderstanding, this narrative misses an entire dimension of this process. E-waste is often bought by overseas buyers who can then resell parts or repairable electronics and turn a profit. By failing to confirm that their assumptions are accurate, reporting around electronic waste manages to paint an incomplete and largely inaccurate picture of the problem at hand.</p>
