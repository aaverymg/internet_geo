  <h4>Mimi Onuoha: How We Became Machine Readable</h4>
  <p>In this talk, Onuoha talks about data collection with an emphasis on the importance of the collection process. The data is shaped significantly by the process through which it’s collected- the example she gives is that hate crime statistics will look very different when the data comes from law enforcement versus from victims. She also doesn’t explicitly say this, but an undertone of the entire talk is this idea of consensual and informed human-focused data collection methods as opposed to the exploitation-based data stealing that we often hear about, especially coming from larger corporate entities. She talks about really getting to know her subjects and walking them through every step of the process. This allows the process of collecting data to become a community building practice, rather than an exploitative one. The other interesting idea she brings up is the concept of missing datasets. This, in conjunction with the idea of data as community building, highlights the connection between data and power. Ultimately, data is collected by people who have the power and authority to decide what is being collected, how they’re collecting it, and what they’re going to do with it. With that in mind, it makes sense that data collection practices often are exploitative or insensitive. However, Onuoha’s approach demonstrates that this doesn’t have to be the case. When collected and applied correctly, data can be used to solve problems, both at a larger systemic level (like her example of racial diversity in Broadway roles), and in smaller, more personal settings (like her example of collecting communication data from a group of coworkers). We can use data to better understand patterns and circumstances, but only if we act carefully and intentionally.</p>
