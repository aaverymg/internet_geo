  <h4>Nicole Starosielski: The Undersea Network</h4>
  <p>I focused specifically on chapter 4 of Starosielski’s “The Undersea Network”, which talked about sociopolitical barriers to the development of undersea cable networks. She discussed several other factors and systems that are often prioritized over cable development, including natural space, the fishing industry, and security concerns. She also discusses how the barriers to development that are created by these priorities can be overcome. She talks about some of the community outreach and public relations work that cable companies are engaged in, which I found really fascinating. Rather than trying to work with larger national governments to force the development of cable networks and landing sites without any input, communications companies have often instead tried to establish relationships with the other involved parties to make sure everyone understands why the development of these networks is important. The specific examples highlighted by Starosielski include relationships with local fishermen, and with locals on O’ahu (the site of a major cable landing point). Both groups were resistant to the development of new cables; undersea cables can damage fishing equipment and lead to stricter regulations of ocean space, and O’ahu locals were worried about disruption to their necessary transportation infrastructure and environmental damage. Rather than pushing ahead with development without consulting anyone involved, cable companies worked to establish relationships with both parties, as well as creating incentives for the impacted groups, such as increased funding. These groups are often at odds with cable companies, but “The Undersea Network” considers how this conflict could be avoided. By creating local involvement and understanding of the role that undersea cables play in both local and worldwide systems, some of this conflict can be avoided. It’s possible for these systems to all peacefully coexist and interact, if everyone is willing to work for it.</p>
