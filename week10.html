    <p>Spend the next week collecting a personal dataset and use datawrapper to visualize it. This personal dataset could be anything you'd like. For example you could log each of your meal times, download an app which tracks and logs how much time you spend on your phone/computer, keep track of which routes you take going to school, the number of times you say certain words or perform certain actions etc. During next Wednesday's class we will spend some time looking at each person's visualization and discussing what stories they can infer from those data. </p>

  <caption>I tracked how many hours of sleep I got per night, which I was expecting to be kind of a boring data set, because I'm usually pretty good at getting a consistent amount of sleep. However, I ended up having a very chaotic weekend and not getting enough sleep, and then consequently getting sick and sleeping a lot at the start of the week. I'm not sure if this is the best vizualization of this data- I'm sure there's a more interesting format I could have used.</caption>
