  <h4>Dietmar Offenhuber: Waste is Information</h4>
  <p>This chapter discusses how the public interacts with infrastructure, focusing specifically on processes that make systems more visible. Systems are often invisible to average people, partially because information about them isn’t publicized and partially because structures become invisible through familiarity with them. Even when most of the information is publicly available, getting a complete picture of a system can be difficult. Offenhuber states that “Representations such as diagrams, maps, or data sets are central to reading infrastructures, but they rarely fit together neatly in a coherent and complete image” (pg 30). Considering all of this, the chapter focuses on a specific example of an attempt to make a system visible. It discusses the process of attempting to put trackers on different kinds of waste to track their movement. Logistically, it’s almost impossible to get precise and complete data from a project like this- trackers are fragile and can only communicate under relatively specific conditions. However, any amount of data offers at least a little bit of insight, so the project did allow for the creation of very rudimentary maps of waste systems in the US. Additionally, the process of forcing people to interact directly with these systems creates personal and community investment in them; they stop being invisible because people are direct participants in the systems that impact them.</p>
