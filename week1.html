    <h4 id="list">Prompt: Using this week's readings as a starting point - wander around your city/neighborhood/community and identify three public components of networked infrastructure. Document the pieces through photography, sketching, 3d scanning etc. Try to research the components and learn how they are incorporated into the larger networked environment. We will discuss our findings in next week's class!</h4>

    <caption>I decided to look for networked infrastructure in my neighborhood along a walk to the grocery store. Here are some of my findings:</caption>

    <caption>Security cameras attached to a telephone pole - these were pointing at an intersection, so I assume they're used for traffic control. I saw several other security cameras, but most of them were mounted on stores, presumably for private security purposes.</caption>

    <caption>Slightly hard to see, but some sort of satellite dishes on a rooftop across the street. I couldn't get close enough to figure out what they do or where they connect to.</caption>

    <caption>Not an example of communication infrastructure, but I walk past standpipes like these every day and almost never notice them. Systems like this are literally all around us and we almost never notice them.</caption>

    <caption id="caption">As Burrington mentioned in <a href="http://seeingnetworks.in/nyc/" target="blank">'Networks of New York'</a>, orange markings indicate underground communication cables. There's been a bunch of construction in my neighborhood, so these markings are everywhere- most of them are in the middle of the street, so I couldn't look too closely, but I recognized some of the labels. In the second image, a "shallow" label and an "ECS" (Empire City Subway) label are both legible.</caption>
