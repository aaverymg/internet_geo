      <p>For my final project, I’m hoping to explore internet visualization. I’m planning to create multiple different forms of visualizations to explore a few different interpretations of this idea- some more literal, relying on the physical and tangible properties of the internet, and some more conceptual and artistic. My plan is to track my own internet activity over a set period of time (it’ll either be one 24 hour period or several periods of a few hours- this will depend on how I decide to track my data). Then, once I have this data, I’m planning to create several different varieties of maps to process and visualize this data. In the early weeks of the course, we discussed the idea of a “tangible internet”- I’m hoping to artistically explore this concept. Taking inspiration from “<a href="/media/reimagining internet geographies.pdf" target=""_blank">Reimagining Internet Geographies </a>” by Angela Xiao Wu and Harsh Taneja, I’m also hoping to explore aspects of identity and interaction that are facilitated by the internet, and how they connect back to larger ideas of space and geography. I’m hoping that by mapping this data, I can prompt the viewer to consider the geography and the “space” of the internet. The exact details of the mapping process likely won’t be finalized until I’ve finished the data collection process, but my current plan is to use a tool like Leaflet or Felt to create a more geographically-focused map displaying the locations of the users and servers I connect to, taking inspiration from projects like the ‘<a href="https://www.internetexchangemap.com/" target="_blank">Internet Exchange Map</a>’. Then, I’m also hoping to create some sort of concept map that attempts to visualize the digital “space” that I occupy. My plan is to format this as an interactive webpage, potentially incorporating data visualization tools from d3.js. This visualization will take inspiration from other existing internet visualization projects, such as ‘<a href="http://internet-map.net/" target="_blank">The Internet Map</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://www.opte.org/the-internet" target="_blank">The Opte Project</a>’, but will be focused on a much smaller and more personal scale. Rather than visualizing the entire internet, I’m only trying to visualize my internet.<br><br>The one detail I still need to figure out is how I’m going to track my data- I looked into some packet sniffer and surveillance tools that would automate this process, but didn’t find anything that seemed ideal for this specific project. Most of the tools only track browser history, or track all of the traffic on your network, or generally just didn’t work that well. I also need to track across multiple devices. If I can find a tool to do this automatically, I’ll leave it running for a 24 hour period and use that data. If I can’t find a tool that seems like a viable option, I’ll likely pick a few shorter time periods and manually track my data. This will likely introduce an element of bias into the data, but will also require less processing. I tried to look into how Mimi Onuoha collected data for her ‘<a href="https://mimionuoha.com/pathways" target="_blank">Pathways</a>’ project, but was mostly unsuccessful.</p>
